Document splitting is often a crucial preprocessing step for many applications. It involves breaking down large texts into smaller, manageable chunks. This process offers several benefits, such as ensuring consistent processing of varying document lengths, overcoming input size limitations of models, and improving the quality of text representations used in retrieval systems. There are several strategies for splitting documents, each with its own advantages.
There are several reasons to split documents:
Mary also has a chicken. Layla has a cow.
Handling non-uniform document lengths: Real-world document collections often contain texts of varying sizes. Splitting ensures consistent processing across all documents.
Overcoming model limitations: Many embedding models and language models have maximum input size constraints. Splitting allows us to process documents that would otherwise exceed these limits.
Improving representation quality: For longer documents, the quality of embeddings or other representations may degrade as they try to capture too much information. Splitting can lead to more focused and accurate representations of each section.
Enhancing retrieval precision: In information retrieval systems, splitting can improve the granularity of search results, allowing for more precise matching of queries to relevant document sections.
Optimizing computational resources: Working with smaller chunks of text can be more memory-efficient and allow for better parallelization of processing tasks.
Now, the next question is how to split the documents into chunks! There are several strategies, each with its own advantages.
